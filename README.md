# Stock market data analysis

The mission of this project was to produce a summarized report of daily stock market activity of 2,835 publically listed companies, over a three-year period, and identify the companies that had the largest gains, losses and trade volume. 

Raw data was supplied to me in Excel sheets, 1 sheet per calendar year. I created a VBA script that condensed daily transaction data (nearly 800,000 rows of data) into yearly summary data per company (2,835 companies), and automatically identified the biggest movers. This script is optimized to work with any sheet with data presented in a similar way.
